  *
  * DataLog is passed a "logtype" through the constructor, so that we may 
  * facilitate different types of logging. (email, local_file, ftp, etc)
  * data is "logged" through the public log() method, then a case statement
  * will determine which specific type of logging will take place.
  * All derivitive log methods will be private!
  * For the time being, everything will be done in the DataLog class, although
  * it may end up being necissary that every logtype require it's own class.
  * Example being email. We do not want to send an email for every character
  * pressed on the keyboard. It may be stored in a local file, until program 
  * termination, or sent every hour.
